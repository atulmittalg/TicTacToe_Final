## Purpose

Finding out the result of the classic game Tic-tac-toe using JAVA when a given set of inputs are given for 2 players playing the game.


## Approach

Using JAVA as the base and  Maven to handle the dependencies, following the approach of TDD to achieve the solution, by creating test cases and developing accordingly to pass the test.


## Rules of Tic-Tac-Toe

    - X always goes first.
	- Players cannot play on a played position.
	- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
      	○ One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
      	○ All nine squares are filled.
	- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
	- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

    4. Intellij - Any IDE which supports Java


## How to run the unit test cases using Intellij

    Download project as zip file and unzip the same to a folder. 
    In Intellij Go to 
    File -> New -> select Project from Existing sources -> Next -> Browse extracted folder -> select the pom.xml and will search for maven projects.
    Once Project is checked out -> Right click project in Project Explorer window and select Run All Tests
    Once above steps done All the test cases will be executed and the results will be displayed in the RUN console.
    

## How to run the unit test cases using Command Prompt

    Download project as zip file and unzip the same to a folder. 
    Open a command prompt and goto the project(extracted) folder and execute below commands:
    mvn clean
    mvn install
 
#####After completion of above steps, test report will be available in below path
    <PROJECT_ROOT_FOLDER>\target\surefire-reports\TEST-com.kata.tictactoe.TicTacToeGameTest.xml
    

## How to run the Application using the Runner Class in Intellij
